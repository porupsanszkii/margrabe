In mathematical finance, Margrabe's formula is an option pricing formula applicable to an option to exchange one risky asset for another risky asset at maturity.
Margrabe's model of the market assumes only the existence of the two risky assets, whose prices, as usual, are assumed to follow a geometric Brownian motion. 
In this notebook, there is a Monte Carlo simulation to determine the option price and compare it to Margrabe's formula.
